## Project Overview
Our director has given our team of business analysts at the nationwide retail chain Superstore the job of creating a dashboard to assist our organization in evaluating current sales trends in the marketplace. At the next planning meeting in two weeks, he wants to present recommendations to top leadership based on the dashboard we create. Our director heard anecdotes in many meetings that company revenue was higher this past year of 2022 than in 2021, but that the company is less profitable in 2022 than it was in 2021. Our task is to confirm whether or not the anecdotes are true. Based on our findings, the anecdotes are false: from 2021 to 2022, revenue decreased and profitability increased.
